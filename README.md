## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Harry Reyes Nieva**. I'm a postdoctoral research scientist in the [Division of Infectious Diseases at Columbia University Irving Medical Center](https://www.infectiousdiseases.cuimc.columbia.edu/). I completed my PhD in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) at Columbia where I was advised by NoÃ©mie Elhadad. For most of my PhD, I was also a Visiting Postgraduate Research Fellow in the Department of Medicine at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/). My research in clinical and public health informatics focuses on leveraging human-centered artificial intelligence to advance precision health and learning health systems.

 My work often examines, develops, and applies approaches involving machine learning, natural language processing, and spatio-temporal analysis in addition to traditional biostatistics and epidemiology. I am particularly interested in using and interrogating multimodal data sources and the vast toolbox that computational learning offers to better understand, improve, and facilitate study of health in populations and communities.
